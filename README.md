# Matt Milici Comments

Hello!

You can fin d the majority of the updates I made to the starting file below.

1. HTML Clean Up

   - Changed the title from "Website" to "Milici Horiseon"
   - Updated a manjority of the div tags to be semantic tags.

     - Added <nav> for the nav bar.
     - Added <aside> for the right column.
     - Added <sections>'s for every grouping.
     - Footing already existing.

   - Included a favicon in the Title for additional custimization.
   - Added alt descriptions for all images... "incase any image isn't populated on a user screen.
   - Cleaned up HTML.
     - I noticed an img tab had an opening and closing tag. We did not need the closing tab because images are self-closing.

2) CSS Clean Up

   - I removed alot of the repetition in the CSS file. There were alot of declarations that had the same proporties and values. I was able to group these together using a comma and reduce the amount of code needed. -->
